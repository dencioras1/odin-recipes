# odin-recipes

This is my first TOP project where I make a website dediccated to recipes.
Up until this point I have learnt some basic HTML elements and the more important
attributes that they can have. I have learnt also about general file structure and naming conventions.
Most importantly I have learnt the basics of working with git: commit messages, what 
pulls and pushes are, how to clone repositories, etc.
