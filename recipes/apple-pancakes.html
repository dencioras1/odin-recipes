    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Apple pancakes have become one of my favorite breakfasts nowadays.</p>
    <p>Dead simple to make and does not take that many ingredients either, pairs nice with weekends, coffee and some honey.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients (Hefty portion):</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Two large apples.</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Cinnamon</li>
        <li>Touch of salt</li>
        <li>Butter or Vegetable oil</li>
        <p>When cooking this recipe I don't really follow specific amounts for milk and flour.</p>
        <p>My strategy is pour a decent amount of milk and then keeping adding flour and mixing until the consistency fits my taste.</p>
        <p>If you use more milk, your pancakes will be more crepe like. If you put more flour your pancakes will be a bit thicker.</p>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to cook:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Grate up apples (don't worry too much about the skin.</li>
        <li>Squeeze out juice from grated apples (bonus points if you save the juices)</li>
        <li>Add egg and milk. Start mixing.</li>
        <li>Add flour and mix. Keep doing so until consistency seems right to you.</li>
        <li>Add touch of salt and cinnamon.</li>
        <li>Heat up a pan, add oil of preference and cook those bad boys.</li>
        <li>Serve with toppings of your choice (My personal favorite is honey)</li>
        <p>Enjoy.</p>
    </ol>
