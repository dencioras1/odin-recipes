    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Chana Masala is my go-to recipe whenever I don't feel like cooking, but still wanting a good meal.</p>
    <p>What I like about this dish is its simplicity and low amount of ingredients. You can make this with the bare minmumum chickpeas, canned tomatoes and the spices, and it would still taste great. However, if you add some red onion, fresh coriander, lime and naan bread, you get a really pretty lookin' dish that makes you feel like a chef!</p>
